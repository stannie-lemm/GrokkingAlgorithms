## Chapter 8
### Ex 8.1
*First - place the largest fitting box into the track, then place next fitting maximums until no fillable place left in the track. This strategy is not optimal: can be placed more small items.*

### Ex 8.2
*Visit the most desirable see-sight fitting in time left, until time ends. Not optimal solution.*

### Ex 8.3
*Quicksort searches for global optimal solution, it's not greedy.*

### Ex 8.4
*BFS searches for local optimum, it is greedy.*

### Ex 8.5
*Dijkstra's algorithm searches for local optimum also, greedy.*

### Ex 8.6
*Can be reformulated sa TSP, NP-complete*

### Ex 8.7
*Can be reformulated as set-covering, NP-complete*

### Ex 8.8
*NP-complete*
