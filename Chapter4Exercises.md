## Chapter 4

### Ex 4.4
Find base and recursive case for binary search.

*Base case is array of length 1. If element to find is equal to array element, we can return its index - 0, and None otherwise. If array is longer, we can take its middle element, compare it with the desired element and recursively search in right (if desired element is greater than middle) or left (if desired is less) part.*

### Find estimated time O for several cases:

### Ex 4.5
Output every element of array.

*O(n)*

### Ex 4.6
Double every element of array.

*O(n)*

### Ex 4.7
Double only first element of array.

*O(1)*

### Ex 4.8
Create multiplication table for every element of array.

*O(n^2)*
